                  <p>Cryptocurrencies can act like real money—in a sense, they are real money—but they take a digital
                    monetary form and are not managed or governed by any central authority. A true product of the
                    digital age, cryptocurrencies operate without the involvement of banks, governments, or any
                    middleman. However, in most cases you will need to use a <a
                      href="https://www.sofi.com/invest/buy-cryptocurrency/">digital currency exchange</a> to buy and
                    sell your digital assets. </p>

                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">In 2020, there were more than 50 million blockchain wallet users.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>What provides security is that cryptocurrencies are encrypted (secured) with specialized computer
                    code called cryptography. They’re designed like a complicated puzzle on purpose so that they’re hard
                    to crack (and hack).</p>
                  <p>By September 2020, the number of blockchain wallet users rose to more than 50 million, according to
                    research published by <a
                      href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statista <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>—with
                    Bitcoin boasting more than 7 million active users.</p>
                  <p>Insiders call it “crypto,” so that’s what we’ll be calling it going forward.</p>
                  <h2>How Many Different Types of Crypto Are There?</h2>
                  <p>As of April 2021, there are over <a href="https://blockspot.io/coin/" target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer">10,000 different types <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>of
                    cryptocurrency. </p>
                  <p>The different types of crypto generally fall into one of two categories:<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Coins, which can include Bitcoin and altcoins (non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies)<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Tokens</p>
                  <p>Below, we’ll get into the basics of crypto tokens vs coins.</p>
                  <p></p>

                  <h3>Crypto Tokens vs. Coins</h3>
                  <p>Encrypted coins and tokens can fall under the heading of crypto. And, generally, they can be listed
                    into two sorts of cryptocurrency: alternative cryptocurrency coins (Altcoins) or tokens.</p>
                  <h4>Alternative Cryptocurrency Coins (Altcoins)</h4>
                  <p>Altcoins usually refer to any coins that are not Bitcoins. Bitcoin is a popular digital currency
                    that’s produced by computational solutions to complicated math problems. It works separately from a
                    central bank or state entity (i.e., government-backed Treasury). </p>
                  <p>Some altcoins include:</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Peercoin<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Litecoin<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogecoin<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Auroracoin<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Namecoin</p>
                  <p>In fact, the name “altcoin” actually means “alternative to Bitcoin.” Namecoin is considered the
                    very first altcoin, created in 2011.</p>
                  <p>Like Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies listed here have a limited supply of coins—to keep the balance
                    in check and to reinforce its perceived value. There is a fixed number of Bitcoins that can exist—21
                    million, as decided by the creator/s of Bitcoin, though some remain to be mined. Once all 21 million
                    are tapped (the number changes when new blocks are mined), that’s it. The only way to bring in more
                    is for Bitcoin’s protocol to allow for it.</p>
                  <p>Though most altcoins are built upon the same basic framework as Bitcoin, many claim to be better
                    versions of Bitcoin.<br>
                    Each system can differ from the next, as they’re created to serve various purposes and applications,
                    and identified in different ways. </p>
                  <p>Some coins don’t work with the same open-source protocol that Bitcoin does, however. For example,
                    the following list of cryptocurrencies have created their own separate systems and protocols:</p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethereum<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripple<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Omni<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Nxt<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Waves<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Counterparty </p>
                  <p>They’re each self-supporting, too.</p>
                  <h4>Tokens</h4>
                  <p>Unlike altcoins, tokens are created and given out through an <a
                      href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/investing-in-cryptocurrency/">Initial Coin Offering</a>,
                    or ICO, very much like a stock offering. They can be represented as: </p>
                  <p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Value tokens (Bitcoins)<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Security tokens (to protect your account)<br>
                    •&nbsp;&nbsp;Utility tokens (designated for specific uses)</p>
                  <p>They are not so much meant to be used as money as they are used to describe a function. Like
                    American dollars, they represent value but they are not in themselves of value. Tokens are a type of
                    encryption, specifically referring to the long lines of numbers and letters representing the crypto
                    used in a transaction, such as a money transfer or bill payment. In short, tokens cover a number of
                    meanings.</p>
                  <p>For instance, both Bitcoin and Ether (from Ethereum) are considered crypto tokens.</p>

                  <h2>The Most Common Types of Cryptocurrency</h2>
                  <p>Here’s a list of popular cryptocurrency types and descriptions:</p>
                  <h3>1. Bitcoin</h3>
                  <p><a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is a type of digital
                    currency; it is “cash for the internet.” More specifically, it’s considered cryptocurrency since
                    cryptography facilitates Bitcoin creation and transactions. </p>
                  <p>Possibly the “Kleenex” or “Coca Cola” of all crypto, in that its name is the most recognizable and
                    the most closely associated with the cryptocurrency system.</p>
                  <p>There are <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-there/"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a> more
                    than 18.5 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation, against a present capped limit of 21 million.</p>
                  <h3>2. Bitcoin Cash</h3>
                  <p>Introduced in 2017, Bitcoin Cash is one of the most popular types of cryptocurrency on the market.
                    Its main difference with the original Bitcoin is its block size: 8MB. Compare that to the original
                    Bitcoin’s block size of just 1MB. What that means for users—faster processing speeds.</p>
                  <h3>3. Litecoin</h3>
                  <p>Litecoin is increasingly used in the same breath as Bitcoin, and it functions practically the same
                    way. It was created in 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former employee of Google. He designed it to improve
                    on Bitcoin technology, with shorter transaction times, lower fees, more concentrated miners.</p>
                  <h3>4. Ethereum</h3>
                  <p>Unlike Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> focuses
                    not as much on digital currency as it does on decentralized applications (phone apps). You could
                    think of Ethereum as an app store.</p>
                  <p>The platform is looking to return control of apps to its original creators, and take away that
                    control from middlemen (like Apple, for instance). The only person who can make changes to the app
                    would be the original creator. The token used here is called Ether, which is used as currency by app
                    developers and users.</p>
                  <h3>5. Ripple</h3>
                  <p>Ripple is one type of cryptocurrency on the list, but it’s <a
                      href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-ripple/" target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer">not Blockchain-based <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>. It’s not
                    meant so much for individual users as it is for larger companies and corporations, moving larger
                    amounts of money (its coinage is known as XRP) across the globe.</p>
                  <p>It’s more well-known for its digital payment protocol more than for its XRP crypto. That’s because
                    the system allows for transfer of monies in any form, be it dollars or even Bitcoin (or others). It
                    claims to be able to handle 1,500 transactions per second (tps). Compare this with Bitcoin, which
                    can handle 3-6 tps (not including scaling layers). Ethereum can handle 15 tps.</p>
                  <h3>6. Stellar</h3>
                  <p>Stellar focuses on money transfers, and its network is designed to make them faster and more
                    efficient, even across national borders. It was designed by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb in 2014
                    and is operated by a non-profit organization called <a href="https://www.stellar.org/"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar.org <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Its goal is to assist developing economies that may not have access to traditional banks and
                    investment opportunities. It doesn’t charge users or institutions for using its Stellar network, and
                    covers operating costs by accepting tax-deductible public donations.</p>
                  <h3>7. NEO</h3>
                  <p>Formerly called Antshares and developed in China, NEO is very aggressively looking to become a
                    major global crypto player. Its focus is smart contracts (digital contracts) that allow users to
                    create and execute agreements without the use of an intermediary.</p>
                  <p>It’s going after its main competition, Ethereum, but NEO lead developer Erik Zhang <a
                      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6puffo/we_are_da_hongfei_and_erik_zhang_founders_of_neo/"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mentioned <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a> on a
                    Reddit AMA that NEO has three distinct advantages—better architecture, more developer-friendly smart
                    contracts, and digital identity and digital assets for easier integration into the real world.</p>
                  <p>Ethereum, on the other hand, uses its own programming languages that developers must first learn
                    before creating smart contracts on its platform.</p>
                  <h3>8. Cardano</h3>
                  <p>Cardano aka ADA is used to send and receive digital funds. It claims to be a more balanced and
                    sustainable ecosystem for cryptocurrencies, and the only coin with a “scientific philosophy and
                    research-driven approach.”</p>
                  <p>That means that it undergoes especially rigorous reviews by scientists and programmers. It was
                    founded by Charles Hoskinson, who is also the co-founder of Ethereum.</p>
                  <h3>9. IOTA</h3>
                  <p>Launched in 2016, IOTA stands for Internet of Things Application. Unlike most other Blockchain
                    technologies, it doesn’t actually work with a block and chain; it works with smart devices on the
                    Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
                  <p>All you need to do to use it is to verify two other previous transactions on the IOTA ledger, which
                    is called the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), but IOTA creators call it The Tangle.</p>
                  <p>According to <a href="https://coincentral.com/what-is-iota-cryptocurrency-coin/" target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer">Coin Central <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>, this means the
                    devices need to be able to purchase more electricity, bandwidth, storage, or data when they need
                    them, and sell those resources when they don’t need them.</p>
                  <h2>The Role of Miners In Cryptocurrency</h2>
                  <p>How exactly do you get your virtual hands on different types of cryptocurrency? You can buy it the
                    old-fashioned way. Or, you can trade it on an exchange using other crypto (for example, using
                    Bitcoin to buy NEO). Some blogs and media platforms pay its content providers in crypto.</p>
                  <p>Then, there are the <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cryptocurrency-mining.html"
                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">miners <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>. Miners
                    usually don’t pay directly for their crypto; they earn it with their smarts. These tech savvy
                    investors can be compared to the prospectors of the Old West, panning for gold in 1848.</p>
                  <p>The value is built in because the supply is limited—it’s just up to the complex computers to dig it
                    up by cracking codes and solving complicated puzzles. A lot of it is guesswork, but once the “block”
                    (of the blockchain) is solved, the other miners drop what they’re doing and go on to the next block.
                    No parting gifts—the contestants just turn their attention to the next game round.</p>
                  <p>If the puzzle is solved, the reward is a certain amount of crypto, and sometimes even voting power
                    on the platform. As of October 2020, the value of one bitcoin had well exceeded <a
                      href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/cryptocurrency/btc" target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer">$13,000 <span class="site-exit-icon"></span> </a>.</p>
                  <p>Sounds sweet, but mining isn’t cheap. It requires powerful, expensive hardware and lots of
                    electricity. Also, the number of awarded crypto will be going down, usually by halves every four
                    years or so. Unfortunately, that might not do your utility bill any favors.</p>
                  <h3>Forks, Hard Forks, and Soft Forks</h3>
                  <p>Sometimes, a cryptocurrency—whether Bitcoin or an altcoin—forks. This typically happens when
                    systems need an upgrade or update, or occasional steering (ie a large enough group of miners decide
                    to make new rules for the network. </p>
                  <p>You could think of a fork like an actual fork, the kind you eat with. Each prong represents a
                    different open-source code modification, but the prongs are designed to work together to assist in
                    the main function.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, forks happen by accident when nodes start making copies or if they do not recognize
                    conflicting or unfamiliar information or characteristics. This is what leads to the difference
                    between <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-happens-when-bitcoin-forks/">hard forks and
                      soft forks</a>.</p>
                  <h4>Hard Forks</h4>
                  <p>If a protocol is changed so that the old protocol version is no longer valid, call that a hard
                    fork. This could be problematic, because if the older, now-invalid protocol is still running, it
                    could lead you to scratch your head and say, “what the fork?” It could cause confusion and even
                    possibly a loss of funds, because the old and new protocols running together are butting heads and
                    making mysteries.</p>
                  <p>An example of a hard-fork problem—with Bitcoin, for instance, a hard fork is a must when making
                    changes and protocol updates to the Blockchain. The new protocol is cool with the changes, but the
                    old protocol becomes a hot mess, not understanding the new activity going on.</p>
                  <p>Since the old protocol rejects the new changes because it doesn’t recognize them, that causes a
                    traffic jam or worse. The old protocol will claim that the changes and updates are not valid, even
                    if they are. What you then get are two blockchains, one old and one new. As these chains grow, so
                    can your problems.</p>
                  <p>The hard-fork challenge, then, is to get all the nodes on the old protocol to switch to the new
                    protocol all at once, and at the same time. This sounds easy, but technically it’s easier said than
                    done.</p>
                  <h4>Soft Forks</h4>
                  <p>Unlike a hard fork, a soft fork is totally cool with the new changes and keeps working. The old
                    version accepts the newer version. Harmony! The newer, updated blocks become longer, and it becomes
                    obvious that the older (shorter) blocks are obsolete and unusable. This recognition eliminates
                    confusion over which protocol is now the real deal (it’s the newer, valid one.)</p>
                  <p>When a soft fork is implemented, there has to be a “majority vote” on whether to accept it into the
                    established fold. If not, the new soft fork fails, and the rest of the chain simply goes on it with
                    its life with no interruption.<br>
                    Hard-and-soft forking can cause all kinds of unintended consequences. When members of the Ethereum
                    community rejected a hard-fork change and decided to keep going with the non-forked version of
                    Ethereum, that old-school system was renamed Ethereum Classic.</p>
                  <p>When Bitcoin hard-forked in order to add more functionality, a portion of the Bitcoin Cash
                    community was left behind and was cut off from the rest of the network.</p>
                  <h2>The Current View of Crypto</h2>
                  <aside class="pull-quote pull-quote--left">
                    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Bitcoin and other crypto have recently come under fire for their ability

                  <p>Three words—wait and see. And add two words to that—be careful. An October 2020 <a

                      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report <span class="site-exit-icon"></span>
                    </a> stated that Bitcoin approached its highest valuation since 2017. </p>
                  <p>Dead Coins lists 1,050 digital currencies and initial coin offerings (ICO) as either “deceased.” <a

                    as nearly worthless.</p>
                  <p>It’s possible that a good number of those failed cryptos were scams, and the authentic,
                    true-quality systems remain in place.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, from a perception perspective, Bitcoin and other crypto have recently come under fire
                    for their ability to be involved in illegal transactions, thefts, and scams. That’s just one of the
                    reasons that investing in the list of cryptocurrencies out there still carries significant risk.
                    Crypto has also been suspected as being a part of an economic bubble that may still pop. </p>
                  <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                  <p>While Bitcoin launched a new asset class little more than a decade ago, today there are many
                    different cryptocurrencies for investors to learn about and invest in. </p>
